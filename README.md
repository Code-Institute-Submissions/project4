# Cook Book Plus
An online Cook Book where users can find and share their own recipies.

## UX

- As a user I want to share my recipies with the rest of the world
	- I can register an account with my unique name
	- I can post a recipe with ingredients and description and an optional image of the dish

- As a user I want to search for a certain recipe
	- I can do so by searching by name and/or ingredients

- As a user I don't know what I'm looking for
	- The website allows me to sort and display recipies by different criteria. I might just choose something that has many upvotes, as it's likely to be tasty.

- As a user I want to change/delete my recipe
	- I can do so by logging in, navigating to the recipe in question and editing or deleting it.
